#Refactoring old code for the marketing agency Horiseon

##Description

I helped the marketing agency Horiseon refactor old code.
This included;

-Updating semantic HTML elements and structure
-Adding accessible alt attributes
-Adding an updated title
-Adding comments for clarity
-Making tweaks to html and css for aesthetics

##Challenges

-Working on old code instead of starting from scratch
-Difficulty linking local repo and my machine to Github. Status: resolved
-Learning new coding concepts, since I do not come from a traditional technical
background.

##Next Steps

I will wait to see if Horiseon will approve my pull request or if they had other things
that they wanted changed. Currently on standby awaiting Horisean.
